Terrain Programming README

- This project was made to demonstrate knowledge of graphics pipeline by creating terrain on the GPU.

- Added complexity over previous OpenGL Project by introducing tessellation and geometry shader stages and using compute shaders for Perlin Noise.

- Required libraries and solution included for ease (req Git LFS & Visual Studio). TODO - Convert to CMake project. 

- Additional tests for Texture filtering and Cubemapping are also included in the project.
